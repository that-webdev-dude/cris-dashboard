### ReactJS Web Application

CRIS (Client Relationship Interface System) is a [React](https://react.dev/) based Web Application to explore and visualize data about Client relationship & feedback. The app is structured in three main sections:

- a left navigation panel in the form of an expandable navigation drawer
- the main dashboard content
- a navbar including an autocomplete system for searching the available Clients

The main content of the app allows to inspect the data plotted on a diversity of graphs and statistics including the general information of the Client and insights on the Company - Client relationshps.

The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes. The user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy for users to find the information they need and ensuring a smooth UX.
