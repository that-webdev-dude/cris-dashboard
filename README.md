### ReactJS Web Application

CRIS (Client Relationship Interface System) is a [React](https://react.dev/) based Web Application to explore and visualize data about Client relationship & feedback. The app is structured in three main sections:

- a left navigation panel in the form of a navigation drawer
- the main content
- a toolbar for searching and filtering data on the right (navigation drawer as well)

The main content of the app allows to inspect the data plotted on a diversity of graphs, as well as the same data are displayed in a tabular form, where every entry can be inspected in more details by clicking on it.

The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes. The user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy for users to find the information they need.
